# 🚨 I've Moved to GitLab!

**All my future open-source work is now hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/AbdulrahmanNahhas)**  
➡️ **Follow me there:** [gitlab.com/AbdulrahmanNahhas](https://gitlab.com/AbdulrahmanNahhas)

---

### Why GitLab?

- **Truly open source** (core platform is MIT-licensed)
- **No Microsoft ownership** – I prefer independent, community-driven platforms
- **Better CI/CD, built-in container registry, and wiki**
- **Full project transparency and ethical alignment**

> *GitHub is great, but GitLab empowers open source without corporate lock-in.*
